# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm

Part of the second Assignment in COSC 3P71: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

A Genetic Algorithm made using Python to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem according to an accuracy determined by adjustable parameters.

Two crossover methods were used (1-Point and Unix) and the performance of the algorithm was compared between the two methods.
